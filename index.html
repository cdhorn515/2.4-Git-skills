    <h1>Christina Cornell</h1>
    <p>I'm originally from Minnesota. We moved to Texas when I was in the 4th grade, and through a series of moves from north to south I ended up in Greenville.</p>

    <p>In addition to being a musician, before I started coding I was working as a client coordinator for a company that handles the administrative work of 401k plans. </p>

    <p>I love coding becuase it is logical. I enjoy figuring out how things work, and even better, fixing something that isn't. No matter how frustrating it is when your code doesn't work, there's always a solution, it's just a matter of digging around until you find it.</p>
